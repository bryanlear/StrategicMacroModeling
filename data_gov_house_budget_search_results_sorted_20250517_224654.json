A tax district is a unique set of governmental entities that have authority to levy property taxes for the same parcels of land.\n\nReal property is mostly land, buildings, structures, and other improvements that are constructed on or in the land, attached to the land, or placed upon a foundation. Typical improvements include a building, house or mobile home, fences, and paving. Classes of real property include the following: Residential, Agricultural Land, Agricultural Buildings, Commercial, Industrial, Utilities and Railroads.\n\nTaxable values are based on assessed valuations after application of the statutory assessment limitation (i.e. rollback), and is the value to which tax rates are applied (e.g. 2022 net taxable valuations are used for the FY 2024 property tax levies).",

Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

                "description_notes": "The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

Data was collected by the Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA), Airborne Tropospheric Hydroxides Sensor (ATHOS), HOx Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (HOxCIMS), Thermal Dissociation - Laser Induced Fluorescence (TD-LIF), Differential Absorption of CO, CH4, N2) Measurements (DACOM), Differential Absorption Lider (DIAL), Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (CIMS), Non-dispersive Infrared Gas Analyzer (NDIR Gas Analyzer), NCAR NOxyO3, and the Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS). Data was also collected by gas chromatography and fluorescence spectroscopy. Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. ARCTAS was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nYour waitlist ID is your eight-digit birthdate (MMDDYYYY) and your initials. For example, if your name is Michael Jackson and you were born on August 29, 1958, your waitlist ID is 08291958MJ.\n\nIt may take 24 hours for your name to show up on the list after you register.\n\nIf you are at the top of the waitlist there will be a note in the row with your Waitlist ID. Since some beds are gender-specific, it might be your turn even if your name does not appear in the first few rows. Make sure you search your waitlist ID to see if there are instructions to call in. Learn how to claim your bed on the FAQs page.\n\nIf you haven’t already registered, get instructions about how to sign up online or by phone. You can only have one entry in the waitlist at one time.",

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis dataset lists the current campaign filings received by the SFEC; Campaign forms include FPPC forms 410, 450, 460, 461, 465, 470, 496, 497. Refer to the <a href=\"https://fppc.ca.gov/forms.html\">FPPC page for forms represented in this dataset</a>.\nFilings of the following SFEC forms are also recorded in this dataset:\n<ul>\n<li>SFEC161 - Itemized Disclosure Statement for Mass Mailings</li>\n<li>SFEC162 - Electioneering Communication Report</li>\n<li>SFEC163 - Member Communication Report</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nFilings received on paper will not have corresponding data in the Transactions or Summary datasets.\nA \"rejected\" filing is usually one made in error, under the wrong filing account, or containing an error in reporting period.\nAmendment filings supersede all transactions from the original filing and any prior amendments. Transactions from prior filings are removed from the accompanying \"Transactions\" dataset in order to represent the most up-to-date version of transactions.\n\"Filer Name\" reflects the name of the committee at time of filing. Committees can change names over time.\n\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>",

HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nCommittees file campaign statements with the Ethics Commission on a periodic basis. Those statements are stored with the Commission's data provider. Data is generally presented as-filed by committees.\n\nIf a committee files an amendment, the data from that filing completely replaces the original and any prior amendments in the filing sequence.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nEach night starting at midnight Pacific time a script runs to check for new filings with the Commission's database, and updates this dataset with transactions from new filings. The update process can take a variable amount of time to complete. Viewing or downloading this dataset while the update is running may result in incomplete data, therefore it is highly recommended to view or download this data before midnight or after 8am.\n\nDuring the update, some fields are copied from the Filings dataset into this dataset for viewing convenience. The copy process may occasionally fail for some transactions due to timing issues but should self-correct the following day. Transactions with a blank 'Filing Id Number' or 'Filing Date' field are such transactions, but can be joined with the appropriate record using the 'Filing Activity Nid' field shared between Filing and Transaction datasets.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>  \nTransactions from rejected filings are not included in this dataset. Transactions from many different FPPC forms and schedules are combined in this dataset, refer to the column \"Form Type\" to differentiate transaction types.\nProperties suffixed with \"-nid\" can be used to join the data between Filers, Filings, and Transaction datasets.\nRefer to the <a href=\"https://sfethics.org/disclosures/campaign-finance-disclosure/campaign-finance-disclosure-data\">Ethics Commission's webpage</a> for more information.\nFppc Form460 is organized into Schedules as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>A: Monetary Contributions Received</li>\n<li>B1: Loans Received</li>\n<li>B2: Loan Guarantors</li>\n<li>C: Nonmonetary Contributions Received</li>\n<li>D: Summary of Expenditures Supporting/Opposing Other Candidates, Measures and Committees</li>\n<li>E: Payments Made</li>\n<li>F: Accrued Expenses (Unpaid Bills)</li>\n<li>G: Payments Made by an Agent or Independent Contractor (on Behalf of This Committee)</li>\n<li>H: Loans Made to Others</li>\n<li>I: Miscellaneous Increases to Cash</li>\n</ul>\n\n<strong>RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-San-Francisco-Campaign-Filers/4c8t-ngau\">San Francisco Campaign Filers</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Filings-Received-by-SFEC/qizs-bwft\">Filings Received by SFEC</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Summary-Totals/9ggq-m8hp\">Summary Totals</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Campaign-Finance-Transactions/pitq-e56w\">Transactions</a></li>\n</ul>",

SUMMARY</strong>\nThis data represents the boundaries of City-owned lands maintained in the City's Facility System of Record (FSR).  \nNote: Not all lands are within the City and County proper. The City owns properties outside of its boundaries, including lands managed by SF Recreation and Parks, SF Public Utilities Commission, and other agencies.  \nCertain lands are managed by following agencies which are not directly part of the City and County of San Francisco, but are included here for reference: <u><a href=\"https://sfha.org/\">San Francisco Housing Authority (SFHA)</a></u>, <u><a href=\"https://sfocii.org/\">San Francisco Office of Community Investment and Infrastructure (OCII)</a></u>, and <u><a href=\"https://www.ccsf.edu/\">City College of San Francisco</a></u>.\n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe Enterprise GIS program in the Department of Technology is the technical custodian of the FSR. This team creates and maintains this dataset in conjunction with the Real Estate Division and the Capital Planning Program of the City Administrator’s Office, who act as the primary business data stewards for this data. \n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThere are a handful of events that may trigger changes to this dataset:\n1. The sale of a property\n2. The leasing of a property\n3. The purchase of a property\n4. The change in jurisdiction of a property (e.g. from MTA to DPW)\n5. The removal or improvement of the property\nEach of these changes triggers a workflow that updates the FSR. The Real Estate Division and Capital Planning make updates on an ongoing basis. The full dataset is reviewed quarterly to ensure nothing is missing or needs to be corrected. \nUpdates to the data, once approved, are immediately reflected in the internal system and are updated here in the open dataset on a monthly basis.\n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nSee <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/8sce-d4fx\">here</a></u> for an interactive map of all the City lands in this dataset. \nTo track the facilities on City lands, join this dataset to the <u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/nc68-ngbr\">City Facilities</a></u> dataset using the land_id field. \nIf you see an error in the data, you can submit a change request with the relevant information to dtis.helpdesk@sfgov.org. Please be as specific about the error as you can (including relevant land_id(s)). \n\n<strong>E. RELATED DATASETS</strong>\n<u><a href=\"https://data.sfgov.org/d/nc68-ngbr\">City Facilities</a></u>",

SUMMARY</strong>\nBeginning in 2022, <u><a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/rent-board-housing-inventory\">the law requires owners of residential housing units in San Francisco to report certain information about their units to the San Francisco Rent Board on an annual basis</a></u>.  For units (other than condominium units) in buildings of 10 residential units or more, owners were required to begin reporting this information to the Rent Board by July 1, 2022, with updates due on March 1, 2023 and every March 1 thereafter. For condominium units and units in buildings with less than 10 residential units, reporting began on March 1, 2023 with updates due every March 1 thereafter. Owners are also required to inform the Rent Board within 30 days of any change in the name or business contact information of the owner or designated property manager. The Rent Board uses this information to create and maintain a “housing inventory” of all units in San Francisco that are subject to the Rent Ordinance. \n\n<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>\nThe Rent Board has developed a secure website  <u><a href=\"https://portal.sfrb.org/FrontPortal/Page/RenderPage?tabId=20\">portal</a></u> that provides an interface for owners to submit the required information (The Housing Inventory). The Rent Board uses the information provided to generate reports and surveys, to investigate and analyze rents and vacancies, to monitor compliance with the Rent Ordinance, and to assist landlords and tenants and other City departments as needed. The Rent Board may not use the information to operate a “rental registry” within the meaning of California Civil Code Sections 1947.7 – 1947.8.\n\n<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>\nThe Housing Inventory is continuously updated as it receives submissions from the public. The portal is available to the public 24/7. The Rent Board Staff also makes regular updates to the data during regular business hours, and the data is shared to DataSF every 24 hours.  \n\n<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>\nIt is important to note that this dataset contains information submitted by residential property owners and tenants. The Rent Board does not review or verify the accuracy of the data submitted. Please note that historical data is subject to change. \n\n<strong>Notes for Analysis</strong>\n- Addresses have been anonymized to the block level\n- Latitude & Longitude are the closest mid-block point to the unit\n- Each row is a unit. To count total units, first select a year then count unique ids. Do not sum unit count.",

Classes of real property include the following: Residential, Agricultural Land, Agricultural Buildings, Commercial, Industrial, Utilities and Railroads.\n\nTaxable values are based on assessed valuations after application of the statutory assessment limitation (i.e. rollback), and is the value to which tax rates are applied (e.g. 2022 net taxable valuations are used for the FY 2024 property tax levies).",

Current policy requires that every acre of BLM land be inventoried for visual values and be assigned one of four VRI classes (Class I, II, III, or IV). Class I is reserved for those areas where a management decision has been made previously to maintain a natural landscape. This includes areas such as national wilderness areas, the wild section of national wild and scenic rivers, and other congressionally and administratively designated areas where decisions have been made to preserve a natural landscape. The inventory classes provide the basis for considering visual values in the resource management planning (RMP) process and constitute the current state of visual resource values as part of the affected environment sections of environmental analyses. Particularly, this data pertains Visual Resource National, State, District and Field Office leads and any group, program, or organization that is involved with surface disturbance activities or visually altering activities, including: Land Use Planners, Realty Specialists, Recreation Planners, Natural Resource Specialists, Landscape Architects, Cultural Resource Specialists, Fluid Minerals and Renewable Energy.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance.

Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

                "description_notes": "ARCTAS_AerosolTraceGas_AircraftInSitu_DC8_Data is the in-situ aerosol trace gas data collected by the DC-8 aircraft during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft & Satellites (ARCTAS) mission. Data was collected by ion chromatographs, gamma ray spectrometers, and alpha-spectrometers. Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. ARCTAS was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

                "description_notes": "The yearly Supplement to the President`s Budget for the NITRD Program is designed to present a succinct technical summary of the research activities planned and coordinated through NITRD in a given Federal budget cycle, as required by law. The Supplement is organized by PCA, to align with the structure of the Program. Every PCA section follows the same format, so that readers can quickly identify: The NITRD member agencies and participating agencies active in the PCA; The definition of the research covered in the PCA;The interagency strategic priorities in the PCA for the forthcoming fiscal year; Budget highlights ? agencies` key RD programs and topical emphases in the PCA for the forthcoming year; Interagency coordination ? current and planned activities in which multiple agencies are collaborating; Ongoing core activities of each agency in the PCA; The NITRD Supplement also includes an annual budget table and budget analysis section, organized by PCA and by agency, to facilitate budgetary and programmatic comparisons from year to year.The Supplement itself is a product of NITRD coordination: The text is developed, revised, reviewed, and approved by the NITRD agencies in a collaborative process over a six-month period prior to the release of the President`s budget. The process begins with an Annual Planning Meeting APM in each NITRD PCA. In these day-long gatherings, agency representatives present briefings summarizing their agencies` IT research priorities, program plans, and current activities in the PCA. Following the briefings, the agencies discuss shared research issues and plan cooperative activities. The Supplement`s PCA sections are based on the APM discussions and subsequent refining of the text by the agencies. For example, the IWG and CG members review and update their PCA`s definition statement and interagency R and D priorities to reflect evolution of key technologies and associated research challenges that agencies face in common. The agencies report on their collaborative efforts to address such challenges in the PCA subsection called `Planning and Coordination Supporting Request.`NITRD agencies engaged in R and D and coordination activities cited in the Supplement are listed in NITRD budget order, followed by the participating agencies. If there is a lead agency for the activity, that agency is listed first; agencies listed after the word `with` are in-kind contributors rather than funders or performers. Some large-scale activities may be cited in more than one PCA because they involve R and D efforts in a variety of technologies. In such cases, agencies report the portion of program funding in each relevant PCA.The President`s 2012 budget request for the NITRD Program is $3.866 billion; 2010 NITRD actual expenditures totaled $3.793 billion. Details of the budget are presented in the table on page 28 and discussed in the budget analysis section beginning on page 30.",

Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

                "description_notes": "ARCTAS_MetNav_AircraftInSitu_DC8_Data is the in-situ meteorological and navigational data for the DC-8 aircraft collected during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft & Satellites sub-orbital campaign. Also featured in this product is water vapor data from the DLH. Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. ARCTAS was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

However, summaries of nutrients within accumulative watersheds are needed to develop accurate watershed-level nutrient budgets and relate landscape inputs to instream nutrient concentrations. This subproduct will accumulate the Nutrient Inventory across available years for all streams and lakes within the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset Plus version 2 (NHDPlus), i.e., 2.6 million stream segments and nearly 400,000 lakes across the conterminous US. These data will allow OW to easily and rapidly identify the dominant sources of N or P for any stream segment or lake in the US. Further, these data will be made accessible through the EPA’s StreamCat and LakeCat datasets and a soon-to-be released online database and an application programming interface (API). This database and API will make nutrient watershed accumulations readily accessible and easily integrated by a variety of OW programs and tools. Finally, the accumulated nutrient data will serve as the basis for a multiple proposed StRAP subproducts and models in SSWR.401, SSWR.404, and SSWR.405. These data will contribute directly to OW, region, and state efforts to identify and reduce non-point nutrient sources.  Having spatially explicit data about nutrient sources and loads can help target and inform restoration and conservation efforts, as well as more formal TMDLs, nutrient reduction plans, and groundwater management approaches. This subproduct will produce a database of accumulated nutrient values for at least 2.6 million stream segments and 400,000 lakes of the medium resolution National Hydrography Dataset Plus version 2 (NHDPlus). These data will be made accessible through the StreamCat and LakeCat datasets. They will also be made available as an online database with application programming interface (API) that will facilitate data acquisition and use by OW and state partners. This database will provide a state-of-the science accounting of nutrient sources that drain to all streams and lakes in the conterminous US. It will allow EPA and state partners to identify dominant sources of N and P to individual waterbodies and will greatly facilitate nutrient reduction strategies and planning.  ",

                "description_notes": "These data depict the locations (only) of all Brook Trout Genetics study sites in the park. Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) is committed to monitoring ecological and evolutionary functions and processes of park ecosystems. Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only salmonid native to the Southern Appalachians and functions as a keystone species in some headwater streams. The historic use of hatchery-reared brook trout for supplemental and restorative stocking in GRSM underscores the need to recognize the evolutionary relationship among stream populations. A recent survey of microsatellite DNA variation in GRSM brook trout indicated the presence of highly significant differentiation at all hieratical levels which suggests that the individual stream should be considered the unit of management. Given that management resources are limited and that stream-specific management is often not practical, fisheries managers need to know whether the genetic divergence observed among GRSM brook trout reflect adaptive differences or is the variation due to stochastic processes like random genetic drift. DNA microarrays are a powerful method for the global analysis of steady-state intracellular mRNA levels, and thus identifying genes that are transcriptionally modulated as a consequence of metabolic or bioenergetic demands. The information gathered from these arrays of gene sequences can be used to characterize complex biological processes and interactions providing insight into the adaptive significance of observed genetic differentiation. This research objective, if funded, would represent the first attempt at determining whether GRSM fisheries managers should focus their resources on genetic relatedness or demographics.\n\nBrook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is the only trout native to the Southern Appalachians. Since the turn of the century, this native trout has lost approximately 75 percent of its range in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) (Kelly et al. 1980). Initial range loss (about 50 percent) has been attributed to logging and resultant water quality degradation (King 1937). This activity virtually eliminated brook trout in streams below about 914 m (3,000 ft) in elevation. In turn, residents and loggers became concerned because they had nothing for which to fish. To meet the demand for recreational angling at the time (around 1910), logging companies began stocking both non-native rainbow trout and northern brook trout and continued this activity until the Park was established in 1934. The Park continued to allow the stocking of both species until 1974.\n\nPark staff in the 1930s and 1940s saw no harm in stocking rainbows and believed that as reforestation occurred, brook trout would reclaim lost range (King, personal communication). However, distribution surveys in the 1970s showed this not to be true and that 45 percent of the range exclusively occupied by brook trout had been lost since the mid-1930s (Kelly et al. 1980). The decline in allopatric brook trout range was the direct result of rainbow trout encroachment into previously unstocked brook trout streams (Larson and Moore 1985). Native brook trout had become restricted to marginal headwater streams above 1,067 m (3,500 ft), characterized by steep gradients and pH that is naturally slightly acidic. Based on the report by Kelly et al. (1980) it was determined that the only places brook trout could not be displaced are in streams above waterfalls where rainbows could not ascend.\n\nHistorically, local residents were very vocal about introduced northern strains of brook trout being different from the native brook trout or \"speckled trout.\" Studies in the 1950s showed that physical differences do exist between Southern Appalachian brook trout and hatchery fish. In 1993, a study conducted by the University of Tennessee provided conclusive evidence that Southern Appalachian brook trout are genetically distinct at the subspecies level from northern populations (McCracken et al. 1993). This effort collected brook trout from 47 streams across the Park and demonstrated that brook trout in 36 (64%) were pure Southern Appalachian brook trout. Fish from two streams were northern brook trout and the others were hybrids. The report recommends that everything possible be done to protect Southern Appalachian brook trout.\n\nParkwide water quality monitoring was initiated in 1992 as part of the Inventory and Monitoring program. Data from this program clearly show that stream acidity increases with increasing elevation (Robinson et.al. 2001). Models developed by these authors indicate that if current trends for pH continue that in four years that streams above 1,067m (3,500 ft.) will have a pH of 6.0 and in 15 years the pH will be 5.5 this eliminating brook trout and other aquatic species from these stream segments. Brook trout distribution monitoring in the 1990’s has documented headwater range loss in six streams that had brook trout in previous surveys. All losses have been in streams at or above 1,067m and field pH measurements indicate the streams are to acidic to support fish life. These data increase the urgency of restoring stream segments identified in the Park’s Fishery Management Plan for this native trout as rapidly as possible to provide a long-term refuge for native brook trout.\n\nGRSM is committed to developing systematic approaches to inventorying composition and monitoring functions and processes of park ecosystems. The historic use of hatchery-reared brook trout for supplemental stocking in almost every watershed of GRSM and the potential negative impacts to the overall health and long-term maintenance of populations resulting from this approach underscore the need to recognize the lineage of each population. Increased interest in restoring native southern Appalachian brook trout to selected streams in GRSM requires a better understanding of the distribution of native, introduced northern strain, and their hybrids. While genetic surveys have been conducted in selected streams within GRSM, numerous streams remain to be typed to major evolutionary lineage (i.e., southern Appalachian, northern). Knowledge from these surveys should be incorporated into all management efforts to identify unique genetic diversity and to prevent the potential deleterious effects associated with introduction and translocation of maladapted fish.\n\nEcological and evolutionary effects associated with introducing nonnative hatchery strains have been documented for other salmonid species (Ferguson 1990; Allendorf 1991; Evans and Willox 1991; Krueger and May 1991). Potential problems associated with the mixing of genetically divergent stocks of brook trout include the loss of local adaptations, disruption of locally-adapted gene combinations (i.e., outbreeding depression), and the spread of pathogens. Declines in numbers of breeding individuals in populations can result in reduced levels of genetic diversity among wild brook trout populations (e.g., through genetic drift). Moreover, moderate levels of genetic divergence have been documented at local and regional levels, which suggests that extirpation of local populations has likely led to the irretrievable loss of evolutionarily significant lineages. Relatively large genetic differences can occur over short geographic distances among stream-dwelling brook trout populations (McCracken et al. 1993; Perkins et al. 1993); therefore, transplantations of fish may create undesirable effects.\n\nSurveys of genetic variation among brook trout populations have focused on (1) nuclear DNA variation in the form of protein differences or polymorphisms (i.e., allozymes) and (2) cytoplasmic DNA sequence variation in the rapidly evolving, maternally-inherited mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Allozyme studies have demonstrated that some genetic variation still exists among extant inland brook trout populations (Perkins et al. 1993; Kriegler et al. 1995) and that barriers to gene flow primarily existed among brook trout originating in distinct regional river systems (Stoneking et al. 1981; McCracken et al. 1993). Comparisons of mtDNA diversity between brook trout from putative refugial and recolonization zones indicated that large phylogeographic differences were found between northern and southern populations, that collections outside the zone of glaciation were the most genetically heterogeneous, and that multiple refugia contributed to northern recolonization after glacial retreat (Danzmann et al. 1998). [Stan: Insert a couple of sentences summarizing the allozyme results from Guffey et al. for GRSM. Perhaps a sentence summarizing the results from Danzmann et al. 1998]\n\nAllozyme and mtDNA techniques have identified significant, genetic differentiation on a regional scale among brook trout; however, neither technique has detected sufficient levels of polymorphism to allow fine-scale resolution of local sub-population or metapopulation structure (i.e., isolation or high levels of gene flow). Recent studies have shown that microsatellite DNA variation affords the highest resolution of population structure of any technique brought to bear on fish species to date and suggest that in many instances the population unit functions at a finer-scale than the river (Beacham and Dempson 1998; Garant et al. 2000; Spidle et al. In Review). Following the discovery of microsatellite DNA markers over a decade ago (Tautz 1989), thousands of these loci have been described in eukaryotic organisms, including brook trout (Angers et al. 1995; two viable markers). Microsatellite DNA assays permit determination of the magnitude of genetic variation and diversity at the individual and population levels from the perspective of a more highly mutable set of markers. Due to the tendency for hypervariability and because only small amounts of tissue (often taken nondestructively) are required for genotyping, microsatellite DNA markers have supplanted allozymes in recent years as the genetic markers of choice for many management and biological problems including genetic stock identification, parentage assignment, forensics, and genome mapping (Schlötterer and Pemberton 1994; Jarne and Lagoda 1996, Goldstein and Schlötterer 1999).",

                "description_notes": "The Herschel Space Observatory (Herschel) is an ESA (European Space Agency) project with instruments funded by ESA member states. It was operated from May 2009 till April 2013, offering unprecedented observational capabilities in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter spectral range (55-671 microns [um]). Herschel carried a 3.5m diameter passively cooled Cassegrain telescope, which was the largest of its kind and utilizes a novel silicon carbide technology. The science payload comprised three instruments: two direct detection cameras/medium resolution spectrometers, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), and a very high-resolution heterodyne spectrometer, the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared or HIFI, whose focal plane units were housed inside a superfluid helium cryostat. PACS comprised two mutually exclusive sub-instruments: a bolometric camera designed to perform photometry in three spectral bands (70, 100 and 160 um) and an integral field unit grating spectrometer operating over the spectral range from 57 to 210 um with a spectral resolution ranging from 1000 to 5000. SPIRE comprised a three-band photometer, operating in spectral bands centered on 250, 350 and 500 um, and an imaging Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (FTS), which provided low resolution spectra over the 195-670 um band. Both instruments used germanium bolometers operating at 0.3 K and coupled to the telescope with hexagonally conical feedhorns. The photometer and the spectrometer were not designed to operate simultaneously. HIFI was designed to obtain spectra with very high resolution (up to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) in the far-infrared and sub-millimeter wavelengths not directly observable by ground-based telescopes. The HIFI instrument was an heterodyne receiver which provided spectroscopy in the continuous frequency range 480-1250 GHz (240-625 microns) and in the frequency range 1410-1910 GHz (157-213 microns). Herschel had two Announcement of Opportunities (AOs) for Open Time (OT) observations. The first in-flight AO for Open Time (OT1) was opened on 20 May 2010, with a deadline of 22 July 2010. For OT1, 241 observing programs were accepted and the total allocated observing time amounts to 6576.9 hours. The second in-flight AO for Open Time (OT2) was opened on 9 June 2011, with a deadline of 15 September 2011. There were parallel AOs for Guaranteed Time observations, GT1 and GT2, with separate deadlines. The Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Herschel Key Programs (KP) was issued on 1 February 2007, with separate deadlines for guaranteed time (GT) and open time (OT) proposals. The whole Key Program AO process has now been completed, and by coincidence there were exactly the same number of KP GT and OT programs, in both cases 21 programs were awarded observing time. Taken together, these 42 observing programs contained 11,650 astronomical observation requests or AORs (AORs are the primary units of Herschel observing time and are effectively the Herschel &#39;observation units&#39;). The total allocated observing time for these programs was 11,257.7 hours, corresponding to approximately 57% of the nominally available Herschel routine mission science time. Herschel successfully made over 37,000 scientific observations before its helium cryogen was exhausted.

The estimates were derived from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrological model version 4.1.2 with water and energy balance schemes at 0.25-degree spatial and daily temporal resolution for this 38-year period. The gridded output data products are monthly average water balance variables including precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (E), 'P minus E', evaporation, soil moisture in three soil layers, base flow and runoff, snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow sublimation, and energy balance variables including surface temperature, albedo, latent and sensible heat flux, ground heat flux, short- and long-wave and other radiative fluxes. The daily modeled values for precipitation and evapotranspiration were also aggregated to water years and precipitation was also aggregated to a 30-year climate normal average.",

Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

A tax district is a unique set of governmental entities that have authority to levy property taxes for the same parcels of land.\n\nReal property is mostly land, buildings, structures, and other improvements that are constructed on or in the land, attached to the land, or placed upon a foundation. Typical improvements include a building, house or mobile home, fences, and paving. Classes of real property include the following: Residential, Agricultural Land, Agricultural Buildings, Commercial, Industrial, Utilities and Railroads.\n\nTaxable values are based on assessed valuations after application of the statutory assessment limitation (i.e. rollback), and is the value to which tax rates are applied (e.g. 2022 net taxable valuations are used for the FY 2024 property tax levies).",

                "description_notes": "ARCTAS_AircraftRemoteSensing_BE200_HSRL_Data contains data collected by the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) onboard the BE-200 aircraft during the Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft & Satellites (ARCTAS) mission. Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",

                "description_notes": "The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic.

Data was collected by the CCD-based Actinic Flux Spectroradiometer (CAFS). Data collection for this product is complete.The Arctic is a critical region in understanding climate change. The responses of the Arctic to environmental perturbations such as warming, pollution, and emissions from forest fires in boreal Eurasia and North America include key processes such as the melting of ice sheets and permafrost, a decrease in snow albedo, and the deposition of halogen radical chemistry from sea salt aerosols to ice. ARCTAS was a field campaign that explored environmental processes related to the high degree of climate sensitivity in the Arctic. ARCTAS was part of NASA’s contribution to the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements, and Models of Climate, Chemistry, Aerosols, and Transport (POLARCAT) Experiment for the International Polar Year 2007-2008.ARCTAS had four primary objectives. The first was to understand long-range transport of pollution to the Arctic. Pollution brought to the Arctic from northern mid-latitude continents has environmental consequences, such as modifying regional and global climate and affecting the ozone budget. Prior to ARCTAS, these pathways remained largely uncertain. The second objective was to understand the atmospheric composition and climate implications of boreal forest fires; the smoke emissions from which act as an atmospheric perturbation to the Arctic by impacting the radiation budget and cloud processes and contributing to the production of tropospheric ozone. The third objective was to understand aerosol radiative forcing from climate perturbations, as the Arctic is an important place for understanding radiative forcing due to the rapid pace of climate change in the region and its unique radiative environment. The fourth objective of ARCTAS was to understand chemical processes with a focus on ozone, aerosols, mercury, and halogens. Additionally, ARCTAS sought to develop capabilities for incorporating data from aircraft and satellites related to pollution and related environmental perturbations in the Arctic into earth science models, expanding the potential for those models to predict future environmental change.ARCTAS consisted of two, three-week aircraft deployments conducted in April and July 2008. The spring deployment sought to explore arctic haze, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, and sunrise photochemistry. April was chosen for the deployment phase due to historically being the peak in the seasonal accumulation of pollution from northern mid-latitude continents in the Arctic. The summer deployment sought to understand boreal forest fires at their most active seasonal phase in addition to stratosphere-troposphere exchange and summertime photochemistry.During ARCTAS, three NASA aircrafts, the DC-8, P-3B, and BE-200, conducted measurements and were equipped with suites of in-situ and remote sensing instrumentation. Airborne data was used in conjunction with satellite observations from AURA, AQUA, CloudSat, PARASOL, CALIPSO, and MISR.The ASDC houses ARCTAS aircraft data, along with data related to MISR, a satellite instrument aboard the Terra satellite which provides measurements that provide information about the Earth’s environment and climate.",
