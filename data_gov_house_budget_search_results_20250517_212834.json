                        "description": "In 2015, data on health insurance coverage were derived from answers to Question 16 in the American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all respondents. Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

                        "description": "The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

                        "description": "Educational attainment data are needed for use in assessing the socioeconomic condition of the U.S. population. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

                        "description": "The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people (Question 6 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS)). The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

                        "description": "The data on sex were derived from answers to Question 3 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census.

The current edition is version 11.4 (published 24 February 2025).  The 11.4 release contains updated boundary lines and data refinements designed to extend the functionality of the dataset.  These data and generalized derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use.  The contents of this dataset reflect U.S. Government policy on international boundary alignment, political recognition, and dispute status.  They do not necessarily reflect de facto limits of control.\n\nNational Geospatial Data Asset \n\nThis dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDAID 194) managed by the Department of State.  It is a part of the International Boundaries Theme created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n            \nDataset Source Details \n\nSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions, as well as national mapping agencies.  Where available and applicable, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations.  The research and recovery process includes analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data.  Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground.\n\nCartographic Visualization\n\nThe LSIB is a geospatial dataset that, when used for cartographic purposes, requires additional styling. The LSIB download package contains example style files for commonly used software applications.  The attribute table also contains embedded information to guide the cartographic representation.  Additional discussion of these considerations can be found in the Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization section below.  \n\nAdditional cartographic information pertaining to the depiction and description of international boundaries or areas of special sovereignty can be found in Guidance Bulletins published by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues:  https://data.geodata.state.gov/guidance/index.html\n\nContact\n\nDirect inquiries to internationalboundaries@state.gov.\nDirect download: https://data.geodata.state.gov/LSIB.zip\n\nAttribute Structure\n\nThe dataset uses the following attributes divided into two categories:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | Core\nCC1_GENC3 | Extension\nCC1_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY1 | Core\nCC2 | Core\nCC2_GENC3 | Extension\nCC2_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY2 | Core\nRANK | Core\nLABEL | Core\nSTATUS | Core\nNOTES | Core\nLSIB_ID | Extension\nANTECIDS | Extension\nPREVIDS | Extension\nPARENTID | Extension\nPARENTSEG | Extension\n\nThese attributes have external data sources that update separately from the LSIB:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | GENC\nCC1_GENC3 | GENC\nCC1_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY1 | DoS Lists\nCC2 | GENC\nCC2_GENC3 | GENC\nCC2_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY2 | DoS Lists\nLSIB_ID | BASE\nANTECIDS | BASE\nPREVIDS | BASE\nPARENTID | BASE\nPARENTSEG | BASE\n\nThe core attributes listed above describe the boundary lines contained within the LSIB dataset.  Removal of core attributes from the dataset will change the meaning of the lines.  An attribute status of “Extension” represents a field containing data interoperability information.  Other attributes not listed above include “FID”, “Shape_length” and “Shape.” These are components of the shapefile format and do not form an intrinsic part of the LSIB. \n\nCore Attributes\n\nThe eight core attributes listed above contain unique information which, when combined with the line geometry, comprise the LSIB dataset.  These Core Attributes are further divided into Country Code and Name Fields and Descriptive Fields. \n\nCounty Code and Country Name Fields \n\n“CC1” and “CC2” fields are machine readable fields that contain political entity codes.  These are two-character codes derived from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC), Edition 3 Update 18.  “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC3” fields contain the corresponding three-character GENC codes and are extension attributes discussed below.  The codes “Q2” or “QX2” denote a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with areas not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nThe “COUNTRY1” and “COUNTRY2” fields contain the names of corresponding political entities.  These fields contain names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as incorporated in the ‘\"Independent States in the World\" and \"Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty\" lists maintained by the Department of State.  To ensure maximum compatibility, names are presented without diacritics and certain names are rendered using common cartographic abbreviations.  Names for lines associated with the code \"Q2\" are descriptive and not necessarily BGN-approved. Names rendered in all CAPITAL LETTERS denote independent states.   Names rendered in normal text represent dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, or are otherwise presented for the convenience of the user.\n\nDescriptive Fields\n\nThe following text fields are a part of the core attributes of the LSIB dataset and do not update from external sources. They provide additional information about each of the lines and are as follows:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | CONTAINS NULLS\nRANK | No\nSTATUS | No \nLABEL | Yes\nNOTES | Yes\n\nNeither the \"RANK\" nor \"STATUS\" fields contain null values; the \"LABEL\" and \"NOTES\" fields do.\nThe \"RANK\" field is a numeric expression of the \"STATUS\" field.  Combined with the line geometry, these fields encode the views of the United States Government on the political status of the boundary line.\n\nATTRIBUTE NAME | | VALUE |\nRANK | 1 | 2 | 3\nSTATUS | International Boundary | Other Line of International Separation | Special Line\n\nA value of “1” in the “RANK” field corresponds to an \"International Boundary\" value in the “STATUS” field.  Values of ”2” and “3” correspond to “Other Line of International Separation” and “Special Line,” respectively.\n\nThe “LABEL” field contains required text to describe the line segment on all finished cartographic products, including but not limited to print and interactive maps.  \n\nThe “NOTES” field contains an explanation of special circumstances modifying the lines.  This information can pertain to the origins of the boundary lines, limitations regarding the purpose of the lines, or the original source of the line.\n\nUse of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization \n\nSeveral of the Core Attributes provide information required for the proper cartographic representation of the LSIB dataset.  The cartographic usage of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundary lines.  Specifically, this differentiation must be between:\n\n- International Boundaries (Rank 1);\n- Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2); and\n- Special Lines (Rank 3).\n\nRank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent.  Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines.  Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2.  Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the “Label” field.  Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary.  Please consult the style files in the download package for examples of this depiction.\n\nThe requirement to incorporate the contents of the \"LABEL\" field on cartographic products is scale dependent.  If a label is legible at the scale of a given static product, a proper use of this dataset would encourage the application of that label.  Using the contents of the \"COUNTRY1\" and \"COUNTRY2\" fields in the generation of a line segment label is not required.  The \"STATUS\" field contains the preferred description for the three LSIB line types when they are incorporated into a map legend but is otherwise not to be used for labeling. \n\nUse of the “CC1,” “CC1_GENC3,” “CC2,” “CC2_GENC3,” “RANK,” or “NOTES” fields for cartographic labeling purposes is prohibited.\n\nExtension Attributes\n\nCertain elements of the attributes within the LSIB dataset extend data functionality to make the data more interoperable or to provide clearer linkages to other datasets.\n\nThe fields “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC” contain the corresponding three-character GENC code to the “CC1” and “CC2” attributes.  The code “QX2” is the three-character counterpart of the code “Q2,” which denotes a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with a geographic area not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nTo allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and World Polygons dataset, the “CC1_WPID” and “CC2_WPID” fields contain a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), version 4, which provides a stable description of each geographic entity in a boundary pair relationship.  Each UUID corresponds to a geographic entity listed in the World Polygons dataset.  These fields allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and the overall World Polygons dataset. \n\nFive additional fields in the LSIB expand on the UUID concept and either describe features that have changed across space and time or indicate relationships between previous versions of the feature.\n\n1. The “LSIB_ID” attribute is a UUID value that defines a specific instance of a feature.  Any change to the feature in a lineset requires a new “LSIB_ID.”\n2. The “ANTECIDS,” or antecedent ID, is a UUID that references line geometries from which a given line is descended in time.  It is used when there is a feature that is entirely new, not when there is a new version of a previous feature.  This is generally used to reference countries that have dissolved.\n3. The “PREVIDS,” or Previous ID, is a UUID field that contains old versions of a line.  This is an additive field, that houses all Previous IDs.  A new version of a feature is defined by any change to the feature—either line geometry or attribute—but it is still conceptually the same feature.\n4. The “PARENTID” field introduces a concept of hierarchy into the data model.  This UUID field links related Rank 2 and Rank 3 lines to their corresponding Rank 1 line.  If two political entities share multiple boundary lines of different Rank or Status, this field contains an identifier that assembles all line segments together.\n5. The “PARENTSEG” field, which is a future-use field, contains information pertaining to constituent parts of a boundary line of the same rank or status.\n\nExternal Data Sources\n\nCertain elements of the LSIB incorporate elements of other published data sources. These include: \n\n- Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Registry: https://nsgreg.nga.mil/GENC-overview.jsp\n- U.S. Department of State List of Independent States in the World: https://www.state.gov/independent-states-in-the-world/\n- U.S. Department of State List of Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: https://www.state.gov/dependencies-and-areas-of-special-sovereignty/\n- U.S. Department of State Boundaries and Sovereignty Encyclopedia (BASE): https://statetoday.net/base (USG only)\n\nThe LSIB also includes elements of two other NGDAs: \n\n- The source for the U.S.—Canada international boundary (NGDAID97) is the International Boundary Commission: https://www.internationalboundarycommission.org/en/maps-coordinates/coordinates.php\n- The source for the “International Boundary between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico” (NGDAID82) is the International Boundary and Water Commission: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?q=usibwc",

This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.

The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.\r\n\r\nContract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nIf the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.\r\n\r\nIf a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge also is paid by the renter to the owner, the condominium fee or carrying charge was included as rent.\r\n\r\nIf a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers, was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency, or the government through subsidies or vouchers.\r\n\r\nContract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels, and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent.\r\n\r\nAggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

The questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people on temporary layoff who were available for work; (3) people who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (4) people who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week; and (5) people not in the labor force. \r\n\r\nThe employment status data shown in ACS tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. \r\n\r\nEmployment status is key to understanding work and unemployment patterns and the availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. 63 Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training. The impact of immigration on the economy and job markets is determined partially by labor force data, and this information is included in required reports to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, uses data about employed workers as part of the criteria for defining metropolitan areas. The Bureau of Economic Analysis uses this information, in conjunction with other data, to develop its state per capita income estimates used in the allocation formulas and eligibility criteria for many federal programs such as Medicaid."

Under the Voting Rights Act, language is needed to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. The Census Bureau is directed, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English-speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses these data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts.

                        "description": "Poverty statistics in American Community Survey (ACS) products adhere to the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. \r\n\r\nHow the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status \r\n\r\nIn determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). \r\n\r\nTo determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.\r\n\r\nPoverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months \r\n\r\nSince poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder."

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. \r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. \r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then 108 either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were imputed."

                        "description": "The data on vacancy status were obtained only for a sample of cases in the computer-assisted personal interview (known as “CAPI”) follow-up by field representatives. Data on vacancy status were obtained at the time of the personal visit. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by field representatives obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others.\r\n\r\nVacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nVacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Rent – These are vacant units offered “for rent,” and vacant units offered either “for rent” or “for sale.” Rented, Not Occupied – These are vacant units rented but not yet occupied, including units where money has been paid or agreed upon, but the renter has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale” they are included in the “for rent” classification.\r\n\r\nSold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or timesharing condominiums, also are included here.\r\n\r\nFor Migrant Workers – These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.)\r\n\r\nOther Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner.\r\n\r\nHomeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nRental Vacancy Rate – The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant “for rent.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for rent” by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are “for rent,” and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nAvailable Housing Vacancy Rate – The proportion of the housing inventory that is vacant for-sale only and vacant-for-rent. It is computed by dividing the sum of vacant-for-sale only housing units and vacant-for-rent housing units, by the sum of occupied units, vacant-for-sale only housing units, vacant-sold-not occupied housing units, vacant-for-rent housing units, and vacant-rented-not-occupied housing units, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth."

The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house or mobile home was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house or mobile home and the land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) originally administered the NFIP, and Congress subsequently transferred the NFIP to FEMA upon its creation in 1979. FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures, to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. rnrnThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. rnrnThis dataset is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.rnrnThe NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf ) defines for the WYO companies how to report policy and claims information to the NFIP. The Flood Insurance Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/home/manuals ) establishes how claims should be adjusted. The NFIP has provided answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public in understanding and navigating the data our program makes available:  https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nfip-data-faqs.pdfrnrnThis dataset represents more than 2,000,000 claims transactions, in order to improve accessibility, we have one compressed file.

Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

                        "description": "The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation.\r\n\r\nData on school enrollment and grade or level attending were derived from answers to Question 10 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). People were classified as enrolled in school if they were attending a public or private school or college at any time during the 3 months prior to the time of interview. The question included instructions to “include only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.” Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of\r\na person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area.\r\n\r\nSchool enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in “vocational, technical, or business school” such as post secondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and on job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire includes instructions for how to classify home schoolers."

                        "description": "The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people (Question 6 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS)). The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

                        "description": "The data on sex were derived from answers to Question 3 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

                        "description": "A housing unit may be a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census.

It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment.

                        "description": "In 2015, data on health insurance coverage were derived from answers to Question 16 in the American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all respondents. Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

                        "description": "The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census.

Data are available for states, counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts, block groups, and, where applicable, American Indian and Alaskan Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands. The SF1 data are available on the Bureau's web site and may be retrieved from American FactFinder as tables, lists, or maps. Users may also download a set of compressed ASCII files for each state via the Bureau's FTP server. There are over 8000 data items available for each geographic area. The full listing of these data items is available here as a downloadable compressed data base file named TABLES.ZIP. The uncompressed is in FoxPro data base file (dbf) format and may be imported to ACCESS, EXCEL, and other software formats. While all of this information is useful, the Office of Community Planning and Development has downloaded selected information for all states and areas and is making this information available on the CPD web pages. The tables and data items selected are those items used in the CDBG and HOME allocation formulas plus topics most pertinent to the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), the Consolidated Plan, and similar overall economic and community development plans. The information is contained in five compressed (zipped) dbf tables for each state. When uncompressed the tables are ready for use with FoxPro and they can be imported into ACCESS, EXCEL, and other spreadsheet, GIS and database software. The data are at the block group summary level. The first two characters of the file name are the state abbreviation. The next two letters are BG for block group. Each record is labeled with the code and name of the city and county in which it is located so that the data can be summarized to higher-level geography. The last part of the file name describes the contents . The GEO file contains standard Census Bureau geographic identifiers for each block group, such as the metropolitan area code and congressional district code. The only data included in this table is total population and total housing units. POP1 and POP2 contain selected population variables and selected housing items are in the HU file. The MA05 table data is only for use by State CDBG grantees for the reporting of the racial composition of beneficiaries of Area Benefit activities. The complete package for a state consists of the dictionary file named TABLES, and the five data files for the state. The logical record number (LOGRECNO) links the records across tables.",

The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Information for each member of Congress is appended to the Census Congressional District shapefile using information from the Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives' website https://clerk.house.gov/xml/lists/MemberData.xml and its corresponding XML file. Congressional districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. This dataset also includes 9 geographies for non-voting at large delegate districts, resident commissioner districts, and congressional districts that are not defined. After the apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on census population counts, each state is responsible for establishing congressional districts for the purpose of electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other congressional districts in a state as practicable. The 119th Congress is seated from January 3, 2025 through January 3, 2027. In Connecticut, Illinois, and New Hampshire, the Redistricting Data Program (RDP) participant did not define the CDs to cover all of the state or state equivalent area. In these areas with no CDs defined, the code \"ZZ\" has been assigned, which is treated as a single CD for purposes of data presentation. The TIGER/Line shapefiles for the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) each contain a single record for the non-voting delegate district in these areas. The boundaries of all other congressional districts reflect information provided to the Census Bureau by the states by May 31, 2024.

The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.\r\n\r\nContract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nIf the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.\r\n\r\nIf a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge also is paid by the renter to the owner, the condominium fee or carrying charge was included as rent.\r\n\r\nIf a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers, was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency, or the government through subsidies or vouchers.\r\n\r\nContract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels, and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent.\r\n\r\nAggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

The questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people on temporary layoff who were available for work; (3) people who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (4) people who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week; and (5) people not in the labor force. \r\n\r\nThe employment status data shown in ACS tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. \r\n\r\nEmployment status is key to understanding work and unemployment patterns and the availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. 63 Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training. The impact of immigration on the economy and job markets is determined partially by labor force data, and this information is included in required reports to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, uses data about employed workers as part of the criteria for defining metropolitan areas.

Therefore, a person who spoke only English may have had a non-English household language assigned during tabulations as a result of living in a household with a non-English household language.\r\n\r\nGovernment agencies use information on language spoken at home for their programs that serve the needs of the foreign-born and specifically those who have difficulty with English. Under the Voting Rights Act, language is needed to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. The Census Bureau is directed, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English-speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses these data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts. State and local 96 agencies concerned with aging develop health care and other services tailored to the language and cultural diversity of the elderly under the Older Americans Act."

                        "description": "Poverty statistics in American Community Survey (ACS) products adhere to the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. \r\n\r\nHow the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status \r\n\r\nIn determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). \r\n\r\nTo determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.\r\n\r\nPoverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months \r\n\r\nSince poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder."

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. \r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. \r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then 108 either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were imputed."

Data on vacancy status were obtained at the time of the personal visit. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by field representatives obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others.\r\n\r\nVacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nVacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Rent – These are vacant units offered “for rent,” and vacant units offered either “for rent” or “for sale.” Rented, Not Occupied – These are vacant units rented but not yet occupied, including units where money has been paid or agreed upon, but the renter has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale” they are included in the “for rent” classification.\r\n\r\nSold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or timesharing condominiums, also are included here.\r\n\r\nFor Migrant Workers – These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.)\r\n\r\nOther Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner.\r\n\r\nHomeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nRental Vacancy Rate – The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant “for rent.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for rent” by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are “for rent,” and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nAvailable Housing Vacancy Rate – The proportion of the housing inventory that is vacant for-sale only and vacant-for-rent. It is computed by dividing the sum of vacant-for-sale only housing units and vacant-for-rent housing units, by the sum of occupied units, vacant-for-sale only housing units, vacant-sold-not occupied housing units, vacant-for-rent housing units, and vacant-rented-not-occupied housing units, and then multiplying by 100.

FEMA and insurance companies participating in FEMA's Write Your Own (WYO) program offer NFIP insurance coverage for building structures as well as for contents and personal property within the building structures, to eligible and insurable properties. The WYO program began in 1983 with NFIP operating under Part B of the NFIA and allows FEMA to authorize private insurance companies to issue the Standard Flood Insurance Policy (SFIP) as FEMA's fiduciary and fiscal agent. FEMA administers NFIP by ensuring insurance applications are processed properly; determining correct premiums; renewing, reforming, and cancelling insurance policies; transferring policies from the seller of the property to the purchaser of the property in certain circumstances; and processing insurance claims. rnrnThe paid premiums of SFIPs and claims payments for damaged property are processed through the National Flood Insurance Fund (NFIF). NFIF was established by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001, et seq.), and is a centralized premium revenue and fee-generated fund that supports NFIP, which holds these U.S. Treasury funds. rnrnThis dataset is derived from the NFIP system of record, staged in the NFIP reporting platform and redacted to protect policy holder personally identifiable information.rnrnThe NFIP Transactional Record Reporting Process (TRRP) Plan (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/manuals/jan_2015_consolidated_trrp.pdf ) defines for the WYO companies how to report policy and claims information to the NFIP. The Flood Insurance Manual (https://nfipservices.floodsmart.gov/home/manuals ) establishes how claims should be adjusted. The NFIP has provided answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to assist the public in understanding and navigating the data our program makes available:  https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fema_nfip-data-faqs.pdfrnrnThis dataset represents more than 2,000,000 claims transactions, in order to improve accessibility, we have one compressed file.

                        "description": "In 2015, data on health insurance coverage were derived from answers to Question 16 in the American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all respondents. Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

                        "description": "The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

                        "description": "Educational attainment data are needed for use in assessing the socioeconomic condition of the U.S. population. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

                        "description": "The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people (Question 6 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS)). The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census.

                "organization": "Department of State",
                "description_notes": "Overview\n\nThe Office of the Geographer and Global Issues at the U.S. Department of State produces the Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset.  The current edition is version 11.4 (published 24 February 2025).  The 11.4 release contains updated boundary lines and data refinements designed to extend the functionality of the dataset.  These data and generalized derivatives are the only international boundary lines approved for U.S. Government use.  The contents of this dataset reflect U.S. Government policy on international boundary alignment, political recognition, and dispute status.  They do not necessarily reflect de facto limits of control.\n\nNational Geospatial Data Asset \n\nThis dataset is a National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDAID 194) managed by the Department of State.  It is a part of the International Boundaries Theme created by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.\n            \nDataset Source Details \n\nSources for these data include treaties, relevant maps, and data from boundary commissions, as well as national mapping agencies.  Where available and applicable, the dataset incorporates information from courts, tribunals, and international arbitrations.  The research and recovery process includes analysis of satellite imagery and elevation data.  Due to the limitations of source materials and processing techniques, most lines are within 100 meters of their true position on the ground.\n\nCartographic Visualization\n\nThe LSIB is a geospatial dataset that, when used for cartographic purposes, requires additional styling. The LSIB download package contains example style files for commonly used software applications.  The attribute table also contains embedded information to guide the cartographic representation.  Additional discussion of these considerations can be found in the Use of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization section below.  \n\nAdditional cartographic information pertaining to the depiction and description of international boundaries or areas of special sovereignty can be found in Guidance Bulletins published by the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues:  https://data.geodata.state.gov/guidance/index.html\n\nContact\n\nDirect inquiries to internationalboundaries@state.gov.\nDirect download: https://data.geodata.state.gov/LSIB.zip\n\nAttribute Structure\n\nThe dataset uses the following attributes divided into two categories:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | Core\nCC1_GENC3 | Extension\nCC1_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY1 | Core\nCC2 | Core\nCC2_GENC3 | Extension\nCC2_WPID | Extension\nCOUNTRY2 | Core\nRANK | Core\nLABEL | Core\nSTATUS | Core\nNOTES | Core\nLSIB_ID | Extension\nANTECIDS | Extension\nPREVIDS | Extension\nPARENTID | Extension\nPARENTSEG | Extension\n\nThese attributes have external data sources that update separately from the LSIB:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | ATTRIBUTE STATUS \nCC1 | GENC\nCC1_GENC3 | GENC\nCC1_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY1 | DoS Lists\nCC2 | GENC\nCC2_GENC3 | GENC\nCC2_WPID | World Polygons\nCOUNTRY2 | DoS Lists\nLSIB_ID | BASE\nANTECIDS | BASE\nPREVIDS | BASE\nPARENTID | BASE\nPARENTSEG | BASE\n\nThe core attributes listed above describe the boundary lines contained within the LSIB dataset.  Removal of core attributes from the dataset will change the meaning of the lines.  An attribute status of “Extension” represents a field containing data interoperability information.  Other attributes not listed above include “FID”, “Shape_length” and “Shape.” These are components of the shapefile format and do not form an intrinsic part of the LSIB. \n\nCore Attributes\n\nThe eight core attributes listed above contain unique information which, when combined with the line geometry, comprise the LSIB dataset.  These Core Attributes are further divided into Country Code and Name Fields and Descriptive Fields. \n\nCounty Code and Country Name Fields \n\n“CC1” and “CC2” fields are machine readable fields that contain political entity codes.  These are two-character codes derived from the Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes Standard (GENC), Edition 3 Update 18.  “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC3” fields contain the corresponding three-character GENC codes and are extension attributes discussed below.  The codes “Q2” or “QX2” denote a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with areas not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nThe “COUNTRY1” and “COUNTRY2” fields contain the names of corresponding political entities.  These fields contain names approved by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) as incorporated in the ‘\"Independent States in the World\" and \"Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty\" lists maintained by the Department of State.  To ensure maximum compatibility, names are presented without diacritics and certain names are rendered using common cartographic abbreviations.  Names for lines associated with the code \"Q2\" are descriptive and not necessarily BGN-approved. Names rendered in all CAPITAL LETTERS denote independent states.   Names rendered in normal text represent dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, or are otherwise presented for the convenience of the user.\n\nDescriptive Fields\n\nThe following text fields are a part of the core attributes of the LSIB dataset and do not update from external sources. They provide additional information about each of the lines and are as follows:\nATTRIBUTE NAME | CONTAINS NULLS\nRANK | No\nSTATUS | No \nLABEL | Yes\nNOTES | Yes\n\nNeither the \"RANK\" nor \"STATUS\" fields contain null values; the \"LABEL\" and \"NOTES\" fields do.\nThe \"RANK\" field is a numeric expression of the \"STATUS\" field.  Combined with the line geometry, these fields encode the views of the United States Government on the political status of the boundary line.\n\nATTRIBUTE NAME | | VALUE |\nRANK | 1 | 2 | 3\nSTATUS | International Boundary | Other Line of International Separation | Special Line\n\nA value of “1” in the “RANK” field corresponds to an \"International Boundary\" value in the “STATUS” field.  Values of ”2” and “3” correspond to “Other Line of International Separation” and “Special Line,” respectively.\n\nThe “LABEL” field contains required text to describe the line segment on all finished cartographic products, including but not limited to print and interactive maps.  \n\nThe “NOTES” field contains an explanation of special circumstances modifying the lines.  This information can pertain to the origins of the boundary lines, limitations regarding the purpose of the lines, or the original source of the line.\n\nUse of Core Attributes in Cartographic Visualization \n\nSeveral of the Core Attributes provide information required for the proper cartographic representation of the LSIB dataset.  The cartographic usage of the LSIB requires a visual differentiation between the three categories of boundary lines.  Specifically, this differentiation must be between:\n\n- International Boundaries (Rank 1);\n- Other Lines of International Separation (Rank 2); and\n- Special Lines (Rank 3).\n\nRank 1 lines must be the most visually prominent.  Rank 2 lines must be less visually prominent than Rank 1 lines.  Rank 3 lines must be shown in a manner visually subordinate to Ranks 1 and 2.  Where scale permits, Rank 2 and 3 lines must be labeled in accordance with the “Label” field.  Data marked with a Rank 2 or 3 designation does not necessarily correspond to a disputed boundary.  Please consult the style files in the download package for examples of this depiction.\n\nThe requirement to incorporate the contents of the \"LABEL\" field on cartographic products is scale dependent.  If a label is legible at the scale of a given static product, a proper use of this dataset would encourage the application of that label.  Using the contents of the \"COUNTRY1\" and \"COUNTRY2\" fields in the generation of a line segment label is not required.  The \"STATUS\" field contains the preferred description for the three LSIB line types when they are incorporated into a map legend but is otherwise not to be used for labeling. \n\nUse of the “CC1,” “CC1_GENC3,” “CC2,” “CC2_GENC3,” “RANK,” or “NOTES” fields for cartographic labeling purposes is prohibited.\n\nExtension Attributes\n\nCertain elements of the attributes within the LSIB dataset extend data functionality to make the data more interoperable or to provide clearer linkages to other datasets.\n\nThe fields “CC1_GENC3” and “CC2_GENC” contain the corresponding three-character GENC code to the “CC1” and “CC2” attributes.  The code “QX2” is the three-character counterpart of the code “Q2,” which denotes a line in the LSIB representing a boundary associated with a geographic area not contained within the GENC standard.\n\nTo allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and World Polygons dataset, the “CC1_WPID” and “CC2_WPID” fields contain a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), version 4, which provides a stable description of each geographic entity in a boundary pair relationship.  Each UUID corresponds to a geographic entity listed in the World Polygons dataset.  These fields allow for linkage between individual lines in the LSIB and the overall World Polygons dataset. \n\nFive additional fields in the LSIB expand on the UUID concept and either describe features that have changed across space and time or indicate relationships between previous versions of the feature.\n\n1. The “LSIB_ID” attribute is a UUID value that defines a specific instance of a feature.  Any change to the feature in a lineset requires a new “LSIB_ID.”\n2. The “ANTECIDS,” or antecedent ID, is a UUID that references line geometries from which a given line is descended in time.  It is used when there is a feature that is entirely new, not when there is a new version of a previous feature.  This is generally used to reference countries that have dissolved.\n3. The “PREVIDS,” or Previous ID, is a UUID field that contains old versions of a line.  This is an additive field, that houses all Previous IDs.  A new version of a feature is defined by any change to the feature—either line geometry or attribute—but it is still conceptually the same feature.\n4. The “PARENTID” field introduces a concept of hierarchy into the data model.  This UUID field links related Rank 2 and Rank 3 lines to their corresponding Rank 1 line.  If two political entities share multiple boundary lines of different Rank or Status, this field contains an identifier that assembles all line segments together.\n5. The “PARENTSEG” field, which is a future-use field, contains information pertaining to constituent parts of a boundary line of the same rank or status.\n\nExternal Data Sources\n\nCertain elements of the LSIB incorporate elements of other published data sources.

The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.\r\n\r\nContract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nIf the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.\r\n\r\nIf a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge also is paid by the renter to the owner, the condominium fee or carrying charge was included as rent.\r\n\r\nIf a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers, was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency, or the government through subsidies or vouchers.\r\n\r\nContract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels, and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent.\r\n\r\nAggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

The questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over. The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people on temporary layoff who were available for work; (3) people who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (4) people who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week; and (5) people not in the labor force. \r\n\r\nThe employment status data shown in ACS tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. \r\n\r\nEmployment status is key to understanding work and unemployment patterns and the availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. 63 Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training. The impact of immigration on the economy and job markets is determined partially by labor force data, and this information is included in required reports to Congress. The Office of Management and Budget, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, uses data about employed workers as part of the criteria for defining metropolitan areas.

Under the Voting Rights Act, language is needed to meet statutory requirements for making voting materials available in minority languages. The Census Bureau is directed, using data about language spoken at home and the ability to speak English, to identify minority groups that speak a language other than English and to assess their English-speaking ability. The U.S. Department of Education uses these data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts.

                        "description": "Poverty statistics in American Community Survey (ACS) products adhere to the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. \r\n\r\nHow the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status \r\n\r\nIn determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). \r\n\r\nTo determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.\r\n\r\nPoverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months \r\n\r\nSince poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder."

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. \r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. \r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then 108 either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were imputed."

An employee of a private, for-profit company or business, or of an individual, for wages, salary, or commissions. \r\n2. An employee of a private, not-for-profit, tax-exempt, or charitable organization. \r\n3. A local government employee (city, county, etc.). \r\n4. A state government employee. \r\n5. A Federal government employee. \r\n6. Self-employed in own not incorporated business, professional practice, or farm. \r\n7. Self-employed in own incorporated business, professional practice, or farm. \r\n8. Working without pay in a family business or farm. \r\n\r\nThese questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. For employed people, the data refer to the person’s job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job."

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

Data on vacancy status were obtained at the time of the personal visit. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by field representatives obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others.\r\n\r\nVacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nVacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Rent – These are vacant units offered “for rent,” and vacant units offered either “for rent” or “for sale.” Rented, Not Occupied – These are vacant units rented but not yet occupied, including units where money has been paid or agreed upon, but the renter has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale” they are included in the “for rent” classification.\r\n\r\nSold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or timesharing condominiums, also are included here.\r\n\r\nFor Migrant Workers – These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.)\r\n\r\nOther Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner.\r\n\r\nHomeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nRental Vacancy Rate – The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant “for rent.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for rent” by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are “for rent,” and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nAvailable Housing Vacancy Rate – The proportion of the housing inventory that is vacant for-sale only and vacant-for-rent. It is computed by dividing the sum of vacant-for-sale only housing units and vacant-for-rent housing units, by the sum of occupied units, vacant-for-sale only housing units, vacant-sold-not occupied housing units, vacant-for-rent housing units, and vacant-rented-not-occupied housing units, and then multiplying by 100.

Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house or mobile home was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house or mobile home and the land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets.

Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

                        "description": "The data on sex were derived from answers to Question 3 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

                        "description": "A housing unit may be a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms or a single room that is occupied (or, if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census.

The 3DEP data holdings serve as the elevation layer of The National Map, and\nprovide foundational elevation information for earth science studies and mapping\napplications in the United States. Scientists and resource managers use 3DEP data for\nhydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping and visualization, and many other\napplications. The elevations in this DEM represent the topographic bare-earth surface. USGS\nstandard one-meter DEMs are produced exclusively from high resolution light detection and\nranging (lidar) source data of one-meter or higher resolution. One-meter DEM surfaces are\nseamless within collection projects, but, not necessarily seamless across projects. The\nspatial reference used for tiles of the one-meter DEM within the conterminous United States\n(CONUS) is Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) in units of meters, and in conformance with\nthe North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). All bare earth elevation values are in meters and\nare referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). Each tile is\ndistributed in the UTM Zone in which it lies. If a tile crosses two UTM zones, it is\ndelivered in both zones. The one-meter DEM is the highest resolution standard DEM offered in\nthe 3DEP product suite. Other 3DEP products are nationally seamless DEMs in resolutions of\n1/3, 1, and 2 arc seconds. These seamless DEMs were referred to as the National Elevation\nDataset (NED) from about 2000 through 2015 at which time they became the seamless DEM layers\nunder the 3DEP program and the NED name and system were retired. Other 3DEP products include\nfive-meter DEMs in Alaska as well as various source datasets including the lidar point cloud\nand interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Ifsar) digital surface models and intensity\nimages. All 3DEP products are public domain.",

NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.

                        "description": "In 2015, data on health insurance coverage were derived from answers to Question 16 in the American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all respondents. Respondents were instructed to report their current coverage and to mark “yes” or “no” for each of the eight types listed (labeled as parts 16a to 16h).\r\n\r\na. Insurance through a current or former employer or union (of this person or another family member)\r\n\r\nb. Insurance purchased directly from an insurance company (by this person or\r\nanother family member)\r\n\r\nc. Medicare, for people 65 and older, or people with certain disabilities\r\n\r\nd. Medicaid, Medical Assistance, or any kind of government-assistance plan for\r\nthose with low incomes or a disability\r\n\r\ne. TRICARE or other military health care\r\n\r\nf. VA (including those who have ever used or enrolled for VA health care)\r\n\r\ng. Indian Health Service\r\n\r\nh. Any other type of health insurance or health coverage plan\r\nRespondents who answered “yes” to question 16h were asked to provide their other type of coverage type in a write-in field.\r\n\r\nHealth insurance coverage in the ACS and other Census Bureau surveys define coverage to include plans and programs that provide comprehensive health coverage. Plans that provide insurance for specific conditions or situations such as cancer and long-term care policies are not considered coverage. Likewise, other types of insurance like dental, vision, life, and disability insurance are not considered health insurance coverage.\r\n\r\nIn defining types of coverage, write-in responses were reclassified into one of the first seven types of coverage or determined not to be a coverage type. Write-in responses that referenced the coverage of a family member were edited to assign coverage based on responses from other family members. As a result, only the first seven types of health coverage are included in the microdata file.\r\n\r\nAn eligibility edit was applied to give Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE coverage to individuals based on program eligibility rules. TRICARE or other military health care was given to active-duty military personnel and their spouses and children. Medicaid or other means-tested public coverage was given to foster children, certain individuals receiving Supplementary Security Income or Public Assistance, and the spouses and children of certain Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicare coverage was given to people 65 and older who received Social Security or Medicaid benefits.\r\n\r\nPeople were considered insured if they reported at least one “yes” to Questions 16a to 16f. People who had no reported health coverage, or those whose only health coverage was Indian Health Service, were considered uninsured. For reporting purposes, the Census Bureau broadly classifies health insurance coverage as private health insurance or public coverage. Private health insurance is a plan provided through an employer or union, a plan purchased\r\nby an individual from a private company, or TRICARE or other military health care. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in parts a, b, or e were considered to have private health insurance. Public health coverage includes the federal programs Medicare, Medicaid, and VA Health Care (provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); and individual state health plans. Respondents reporting a “yes” to the types listed in c, d, or f were considered to have public coverage. The types of health insurance are not mutually exclusive; people may be covered by more than one at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as other federal agencies, use data on health insurance coverage to more accurately distribute resources and better understand state and local health insurance needs."

                        "description": "The data on value (also referred to as “price asked” for vacant units) were obtained from Housing Question 19 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). The question was asked at housing units that were owned, being bought, vacant for sale, or sold not occupied at the time of the survey. Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the\r\nrespondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house and the land. \r\n\r\nFor vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs designed to meet the housing needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nMedian and Quartile Value – The median divides the value distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median value of the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot (if lot owned), or condominium unit) and one-half above the median.\r\n\r\nQuartiles divide the value distribution into four equal parts. Median and quartile value are computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median and quartile value calculations are rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. Upper and lower quartiles can be used to note large value differences among various geographic areas. \r\n\r\nAggregate Value –Aggregate value is calculated by adding all of the value estimates for owner occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate value is rounded to the nearest hundred\r\ndollars. \r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – The 1996-1998 ACS question provided a space for the respondent to enter a dollar amount. From 1999-2007 the question provided 19 pre-coded response categories from “Less than $10,000” to “$250,000 or more – Specify.”\r\n\r\nStarting in 2004, value was shown for all owner-occupied housing units, unlike from 1996-2003 in which value was shown only for specified owner-occupied housing units. Changes introduced in 2008 were removing the pre-coded response categories and adding a write-in box for the respondent to enter the property value amount in dollars, and revising the wording of the question to ask, “About how much do you think this house and lot, apartment, or mobile\r\nhome (and lot, if owned) would sell for if it were for sale?”\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – The Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the value question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Property Value” in the search box.\r\n\r\nComparability – Caution should be used when comparing ACS data on value from the years 2008 and after with pre-2008 ACS data. Changes made to the value question between the 2007 and 2008 ACS involving the response option may have resulted in an inconsistency in the value distribution for some areas. In 2007 and previous years, the ACS value question included categorical response options with a write-in for values over $250,000. Beginning in 2008, the response option became solely a write-in.\r\n\r\nCaution also should be used when comparing value data from the ACS produced in 2008 or later with Census 2000 value data. The 2008 or later ACS provides solely a write-in response option while Census 2000 collected data in categories. Additionally, Census 2000 tables on value were released for both total owner-occupied housing units and specified owner-occupied housing units, thus comparisons can be made only when comparing the same universes between the two data sets"

Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation. These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. \r\n\r\nBased on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school.\r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2015 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\nThe educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” Respondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some\r\ncollege” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course\r\nwork may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree.\r\n\r\nMaster’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary \r\nmedicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported.\r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported.\r\n\r\nHigh School Graduate or Higher – This category includes people whose highest degree was a high school diploma or its equivalent, people who attended college but did not receive a degree, and people who received an associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, or professional or doctorate degree. People who reported completing the 12th grade but not receiving a diploma are not included.\r\n\r\nNot Enrolled, Not High School Graduate – This category includes people of compulsory school attendance age or above who were not enrolled in school and were not high school graduates. These people may be referred to as “high school dropouts.” There is no restriction on when they “dropped out” of school; therefore, they may have dropped out before high school and never attended high school.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS question does not have the response category for “Vocational, technical, or business school degree” that the 1996-1998 ACS question had. Starting in 1999, the ACS question had two categories for some college: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year” and “1 or more years of college, no degree.” The 1996-1998 ACS question had one category: “Some college but no degree.” In the 1996-1998 ACS, the educational attainment question was used to estimate level of enrollment. Since 1999, a question regarding grade of enrollment was included.\r\n\r\nThe 1999-2007 ACS attainment question grouped grade categories below high school into the following three categories: “Nursery school to 4th grade,” “5th grade or 6th grade,” and “7th grade or 8th grade.” The 1996-1998 ACS question allowed a write-in for highest grade completed for grades 1-11 in addition to “Nursery or preschool” and “Kindergarten.”\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2008, the ACS attainment question was changed to the following categories for levels up to Grade 12, no diploma: “Nursery school,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 11,” and “12th grade, no diploma.” The survey question allowed a write-in for the highest grade completed for grades 1-11. In addition, the category that was previously “High school graduate (including GED)” was broken into two categories: “Regular high school diploma” and “GED or alternative credential.” The term “credit” for the two some college categories was emphasized. The phrase “beyond a bachelor’s degree” was added to the professional degree category.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population in group quarters (GQ) was included in the ACS. Some types of GQ populations may have educational attainment distributions that are different from the household population. The inclusion of the GQ population could therefore have a noticeable impact on the educational attainment distribution. This is particularly true for areas with a substantial GQ population.\r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau tested the changes introduced to the 2008 version of the educational attainment question in the 2006 ACS Content Test. The results of this testing show that the changes may introduce an inconsistency in the data produced for this question as observed from the years 2007 to 2008. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the\r\nsearch box.\r\n\r\nComparability – New questions were added to the 2008 ACS Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments. Respondents who received a high school diploma, GED or equivalent also were asked if they had completed any college credit. Therefore, data users may notice a decrease in the number of high school graduates relative to previous years because those people are now being captured in the “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” or “1 or more\r\nyears of college credit, no degree” categories. For more information, see “Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” from the 2006 ACS Content Test. Go to http://www.census.gov and enter “2006 ACS Content Test Evaluation Report Covering Educational Attainment” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData about educational attainment also are collected from the decennial Census and from the Current Population Survey (CPS). ACS data is generally comparable to data from the Census. For more information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data, please see the Educational Attainment Fact Sheet at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/factsheet.html. \r\n\r\nMore information about the comparability of ACS and CPS data can also be found in the paper “Comparison of ACS and ASEC Data on Educational Attainment: 2004” on the ACS website.

                        "description": "The data on race were derived from answers to the question on race that was asked of all people (Question 6 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS)). The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a\r\nsixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races.\r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder\r\nin a previously processed household were imputed.\r\n\r\nThe concept “race alone” includes people who reported a single entry (i.e., Korean) and no other race, as well as people who reported two or more entries within the same major race group (i.e., Asian). For example, respondents who reported Korean and Vietnamese are part of the larger “Asian alone” race group.\r\n\r\nComparability – The data on race in the 2015 ACS are not directly comparable across all years. Ongoing research conducted following the 1990 Census affected the ACS question on race since its inception in 1996. Also, the October 1997 revised standards for federal data on race and ethnicity issued by the OMB led to changes in the question on race for Census 2000.\r\n\r\nConsequently, in order to achieve consistency, other census-administered surveys such as the ACS were modified to reflect changes required by OMB. The 2010 Census and ACS data collections continue to follow the 1997 OMB Standards.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Race Code List found within the 2015 ACS Code List.

Individuals were asked to mark either “male” or “female” to indicate their biological sex. For most cases in which sex was invalid, the appropriate entry was determined from other information provided for that person, such as the person’s given (i.e., first) name and household relationship. Otherwise, sex was allocated from a hot deck.\r\n\r\nSex is asked for all persons in a household or group quarters. On the mailout/mailback paper questionnaire for households, sex is asked for all persons listed on the form. This form accommodates asking sex for up to 12 people listed as living or residing in the household for at least 2 months. If a respondent indicates that more people are listed as part of the total persons living in the household than the form can accommodate, or if any person included on the form is missing sex, then the household is eligible for Failed Edit Follow-up (FEFU).\r\n\r\nDuring FEFU operations, telephone center staffers call respondents to obtain missing data.This includes asking sex for any person in the household missing sex information. In Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) and Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) instruments, sex is asked for all persons. In 2006, the ACS began collecting data in group quarters (GQs). This included asking sex for persons living in a group quarters. For additional data collection methodology, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Methodology” in the search box.\r\n\r\nData on sex are used to determine the applicability of other questions for a particular individual and to classify other characteristics in tabulations. The sex data collected on the forms are aggregated and provide the number of males and females in the population. These data are needed to interpret most social and economic characteristics used to plan and analyze programs and policies. Data about sex are critical because so many federal programs must differentiate between males and females. \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are required by statute to use these data to fund, implement, and evaluate various social and welfare programs, such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). Laws to promote equal employment opportunity for women also require census data on sex. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs must use census data to develop its state projections of veterans’ facilities and benefits. For more information on the use of sex data in Federal programs, please see http://www.census.gov and enter “ACS Handbook of Questions and Current Federal Uses” in the search box.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio – The sex ratio represents the balance between the male and female populations. Ratios above 100 indicate a larger male population, and ratios below 100 indicate a larger female population. This measure is derived by dividing the total number of males by the total number of females and then multiplying by 100. It is rounded to the nearest tenth."

Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to\r\nthe intended occupants whenever possible. If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the previous occupants. Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in the housing unit inventory. \r\n\r\nBoats,recreational vehicles (RVs), vans, tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as someone's current place of residence. Vacant mobile homes are included provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand. Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage yards are excluded from the housing inventory. Also excluded from the housing inventory are quarters being used entirely for\r\nnonresidential purposes, such as a store or an office, or quarters used for the storage of business supplies or inventory, machinery, or agricultural products.\r\n\r\nHousing units are distinct from Group Quarters (GQs). GQs are places where people live or stay in a group living arrangement that is owned or managed by an entity or organization providing housing and/or services for the residents. These services may include custodial or medical care, as well as other types of assistance, and residency is commonly restricted to those receiving these services. People living in GQs usually are not related to each other. GQs include such places as college residence halls, residential treatment centers, skilled nursing facilities, group homes, military barracks, correctional facilities, workers’ dormitories, and facilities for people experiencing homelessness. GQs are defined according to the housing and/or services provided to residents and are identified by Census GQ type codes.\r\n\r\nOccupied Housing Unit – A housing unit is classified as occupied if it is the current place of residence of the person or group of people living in it at the time of interview, or if the occupants are only temporarily absent from the residence for two months or less, that is, away on vacation or a business trip. If all the people staying in the unit at the time of the interview are staying there for two months or less, the unit is considered to be temporarily occupied and classified as “vacant.” The occupants may be a single family, one person living\r\nalone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living quarters. The living quarters occupied by staff personnel within any group quarters are separate housing units if they satisfy the housing unit criteria of separateness and direct access; otherwise, they are considered group quarters.\r\n\r\nOccupied rooms or suites of rooms in hotels, motels, and similar places are classified as housing units only when occupied by permanent residents, that is, people who consider the hotel as their current place of residence or have no current place of residence elsewhere. If any of the occupants in rooming or boarding houses, congregate housing, or continuing care facilities live separately from others in the building and have direct access, their quarters are\r\nclassified as separate housing units. \r\n\r\nVacant Housing Unit – A housing unit is vacant if no one is living in it at the time of interview. Units occupied at the time of interview entirely by persons who are staying two months or less and who have a more permanent residence elsewhere are considered to be temporarily occupied, and are classified as “vacant.” New units not yet occupied are classified as vacant housing units if construction has reached a point where all exterior windows and doors are installed and final usable floors are in place.\r\n\r\nVacant units are excluded from the housing inventory if they are open to the elements, that is, the roof, walls, windows, and/or doors no longer protect the interior from the elements. Also excluded are vacant units with a sign that they are condemned or they are to be demolished.\r\n\r\nComparability –The ACS estimates of occupied housing units and vacant housing units differ from those obtained from the 2010 Census. For more information, see “Comparing 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates of Occupancy Status, Vacancy Status, and Household Size with the 2010 Census – Preliminary Results” on the ACS website.

The question was asked at occupied housing units that were for rent, vacant housing units that were for rent, and vacant units rented but not occupied at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nHousing units that are renter occupied without payment of rent are shown separately as “No rent paid.” The unit may be owned by friends or relatives who live elsewhere and who allow occupancy without charge. Rent-free houses or apartments may be provided to compensate caretakers, ministers, tenant farmers, sharecroppers, or others.\r\n\r\nContract rent is the monthly rent agreed to or contracted for, regardless of any furnishings, utilities, fees, meals, or services that may be included. For vacant units, it is the monthly rent asked for the rental unit at the time of interview.\r\n\r\nIf the contract rent includes rent for a business unit or for living quarters occupied by another household, only that part of the rent estimated to be for the respondent's unit was included. Excluded was any rent paid for additional units or for business premises.\r\n\r\nIf a renter pays rent to the owner of a condominium or cooperative, and the condominium fee or cooperative carrying charge also is paid by the renter to the owner, the condominium fee or carrying charge was included as rent.\r\n\r\nIf a renter receives payments from lodgers or roomers who are listed as members of the household, the rent without deduction for any payments received from the lodgers or roomers, was to be reported. The respondent was to report the rent agreed to or contracted for even if paid by someone else such as friends or relatives living elsewhere, a church or welfare agency, or the government through subsidies or vouchers.\r\n\r\nContract rent provides information on the monthly housing cost expenses for renters. When the data is used in conjunction with utility costs and income data, the information offers an excellent measure of housing affordability and excessive shelter costs. The data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of people at different economic levels, and to provide assistance to agencies in determining policies on fair rent.\r\n\r\nAggregate Contract Rent – Aggregate contract rent is calculated by adding all of the contract rents for occupied housing units in an area. Aggregate contract rent is rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. This explanation is comparable to the description used for Aggregate Gross Rent.

Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

The series of questions on employment status was designed to identify, in this sequence: (1) people who worked at any time during the reference week; (2) people on temporary layoff who were available for work; (3) people who did not work during the reference week but who had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily absent (excluding layoff); (4) people who did not work during the reference week, but who were looking for work during the last four weeks and were available for work during the reference week; and (5) people not in the labor force. \r\n\r\nThe employment status data shown in ACS tabulations relate to people 16 years old and over. \r\n\r\nEmployment status is key to understanding work and unemployment patterns and the availability of workers. Based on labor market areas and unemployment levels, the U.S. 63 Department of Labor identifies service delivery areas and determines amounts to be allocated to each for job training.

The U.S. Department of Education uses these data to prepare a report to Congress on the social and economic status of children served by different local school districts.

                        "description": "Poverty statistics in American Community Survey (ACS) products adhere to the standards specified by the Office of Management and Budget in Statistical Policy Directive 14. The Census Bureau uses a set of dollar value thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. Further, poverty thresholds for people living alone or with nonrelatives (unrelated individuals) vary by age (under 65 years or 65 years and older). The poverty thresholds for two-person families also vary by the age of the householder. If a family’s total income is less than the dollar value of the appropriate threshold, then that family and every individual in it are considered to be in poverty. Similarly, if an unrelated individual’s total income is less than the appropriate threshold, then that individual is considered to be in poverty. \r\n\r\nHow the Census Bureau Determines Poverty Status \r\n\r\nIn determining the poverty status of families and unrelated individuals, the Census Bureau uses thresholds (income cutoffs) arranged in a two-dimensional matrix. The matrix consists of family size (from one person to nine or more people) cross-classified by presence and number of family members under 18 years old (from no children present to eight or more children present). Unrelated individuals and two-person families are further differentiated by age of reference person (householder) (under 65 years old and 65 years old and over). \r\n\r\nTo determine a person's poverty status, one compares the person’s total family income in the last 12 months with the poverty threshold appropriate for that person's family size and composition (see example below). If the total income of that person's family is less than the threshold appropriate for that family, then the person is considered “below the poverty level,” together with every member of his or her family. If a person is not living with anyone related by birth, marriage, or adoption, then the person's own income is compared with his or her poverty threshold. The total number of people below the poverty level is the sum of people in families and the number of unrelated individuals with incomes in the last 12 months below the poverty threshold.\r\n\r\nPoverty Status of Households in the Past 12 Months \r\n\r\nSince poverty is defined at the family level and not the household level, the poverty status of the household is determined by the poverty status of the householder. Households are classified as poor when the total income of the householder's family in the last 12 months is below the appropriate poverty threshold. (For nonfamily householders, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold.) The income of people living in the household who are unrelated to the householder is not considered when determining the poverty status of a household, nor does their presence affect the family size in determining the appropriate threshold. The poverty thresholds vary depending upon three criteria: size of family, number of children, and, for one- and two- person families, age of the householder."

The U.S. Census Bureau collects race data in accordance with guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and these data are based on self-identification. The racial categories included in the census questionnaire generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. In addition, it is recognized that the categories of the race item include racial and national origin or sociocultural groups. People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as “American Indian” and “White.” People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race. \r\n\r\nThe racial classifications used by the Census Bureau adhere to the October 30, 1997, Federal Register notice entitled, “Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity” issued by OMB. These standards govern the categories used to collect and present federal data on race and ethnicity. OMB requires five minimum categories (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander) for race. The race categories are described below with a sixth category, “Some Other Race,” added with OMB approval. In addition to the five race groups, OMB also states that respondents should be offered the option of selecting one or more races. \r\n\r\nIf an individual did not provide a race response, the race or races of the householder or other household members were imputed using specific rules of precedence of household relationship. For example, if race was missing for a natural-born child in the household, then 108 either the race or races of the householder, another natural-born child, or spouse of the householder were imputed. If race was not reported for anyone in the household, then the race or races of a householder in a previously processed household were imputed."

The Food Stamp Act of 1977 defines this federally funded program as one intended to “permit low-income households to obtain a more nutritious diet” (from Title XIII of Public Law 95-113, The Food Stamp Act of 1977, declaration of policy). Food purchasing power is increased by providing eligible households with coupons or cards that can be used to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the Food Stamp Program through state and local welfare offices. The Food Stamp Program is the major national income support program to which all low-income and low-resource households, regardless of household characteristics, are eligible. In Puerto Rico, the program is named Nutritional Assistance for Puerto Rico (NAP). \r\n\r\nOn October 1, 2008, the Federal Food Stamp program was renamed SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). Respondents were asked if one or more of the current members received food stamps or a food stamp benefit card during the past 12 months. Respondents were also asked to include benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (or Nutritional Assistance for Puerto Rico (NAP)) in order to incorporate the program name change."

These data are needed to determine the extent of illiteracy rates of citizens in language minorities in order to meet statutory requirements under the Voting Rights Act. Based on data about educational attainment, school districts are allocated funds to provide classes in basic skills to adults who have not completed high school. \r\n\r\nData on educational attainment were derived from answers to Question 11 on the 2014 ACS, which was asked of all respondents. Educational attainment data are tabulated for people 18 years old and over. Respondents are classified according to the highest degree or the highest level of school completed. The question included instructions for persons currently enrolled in school to report the level of the previous grade attended or the highest degree received.\r\n\r\n The educational attainment question included a response category that allowed people to report completing the 12th grade without receiving a high school diploma. Respondents who received a regular high school diploma and did not attend college were instructed to report “Regular high school diploma.” \r\n\r\nRespondents who received the equivalent of a high school diploma (for example, passed the test of General Educational Development (G.E.D.)), and did not attend college, were instructed to report “GED or alternative credential.” “Some college” is in two categories: “Some college credit, but less than 1 year of college credit” and “1 or more years of college credit, no degree.” The category “Associate’s degree” included people whose highest degree is an associate’s degree, which generally requires 2 years of college level work and is either in an occupational program that prepares them for a specific occupation, or an academic program primarily in the arts and sciences. The course work may or may not be transferable to a bachelor’s degree. Master’s degrees include the traditional MA and MS degrees and field-specific degrees, such as MSW, MEd, MBA, MLS, and MEng. Instructions included in the respondent instruction guide for mailout/mailback respondents only provided the following examples of professional school degrees: medicine, dentistry, chiropractic, optometry, osteopathic medicine, pharmacy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, law, and theology. The order in which degrees were listed suggested that doctorate degrees were “higher” than professional school degrees, which were “higher” than master's degrees. If more than one box was filled, the response was edited to the highest level or degree reported. \r\n\r\nThe instructions further specified that schooling completed in foreign or ungraded school systems should be reported as the equivalent level of schooling in the regular American system. The instructions specified that certificates or diplomas for training in specific trades or from vocational, technical or business schools were not to be reported. Honorary degrees awarded for a respondent's accomplishments were not to be reported."

Data on vacancy status were obtained at the time of the personal visit. Vacancy status and other characteristics of vacant units were determined by field representatives obtaining information from landlords, owners, neighbors, rental agents, and others.\r\n\r\nVacancy status has long been used as a basic indicator of the housing market and provides information on the stability and quality of housing for certain areas. The data is used to assess the demand for housing, to identify housing turnover within areas, and to better understand the population within the housing market over time. These data also serve to aid in the development of housing programs to meet the needs of persons at different economic levels.\r\n\r\nVacant units are subdivided according to their housing market classification as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Rent – These are vacant units offered “for rent,” and vacant units offered either “for rent” or “for sale.” Rented, Not Occupied – These are vacant units rented but not yet occupied, including units where money has been paid or agreed upon, but the renter has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Sale Only – These are vacant units being offered “for sale only,” including units in cooperatives and condominium projects if the individual units are offered “for sale only.” If units are offered either “for rent” or “for sale” they are included in the “for rent” classification.\r\n\r\nSold, Not Occupied – These are vacant units sold but not yet occupied, including units that have been sold recently, but the new owner has not yet moved in.\r\n\r\nFor Seasonal, Recreational, or Occasional Use – These are vacant units used or intended for use only in certain seasons or for weekends or other occasional use throughout the year. Seasonal units include those used for summer or winter sports or recreation, such as beach cottages and hunting cabins. Seasonal units also may include quarters for such workers as herders and loggers. Interval ownership units, sometimes called shared-ownership or timesharing condominiums, also are included here.\r\n\r\nFor Migrant Workers – These include vacant units intended for occupancy by migratory workers employed in farm work during the crop season. (Work in a cannery, a freezer plant, or a food-processing plant is not farm work.)\r\n\r\nOther Vacant – If a vacant unit does not fall into any of the categories specified above, it is classified as “Other vacant.” For example, this category includes units held for occupancy by a caretaker or janitor, and units held for personal reasons of the owner.\r\n\r\nHomeowner Vacancy Rate – The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant “for sale.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for sale only” by the sum of the owner-occupied units, vacant units that are “for sale only,” and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nRental Vacancy Rate – The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant “for rent.” It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units “for rent” by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are “for rent,” and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied, and then multiplying by 100. This measure is rounded to the nearest tenth.\r\n\r\nAvailable Housing Vacancy Rate – The proportion of the housing inventory that is vacant for-sale only and vacant-for-rent. It is computed by dividing the sum of vacant-for-sale only housing units and vacant-for-rent housing units, by the sum of occupied units, vacant-for-sale only housing units, vacant-sold-not occupied housing units, vacant-for-rent housing units, and vacant-rented-not-occupied housing units, and then multiplying by 100.

Value is the respondent's estimate of how much the property (house and lot, mobile home and lot, or condominium unit) would sell for if it were for sale. If the house or mobile home was owned or being bought, but the land on which it sits was not, the respondent was asked to estimate the combined value of the house or mobile home and the land. For vacant units, value was the price asked for the property. Value was tabulated separately for all owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale housing units, as well as owner-occupied and vacant-for-sale mobile homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of a home provides information on neighborhood quality, housing affordability, and wealth. These data provide socioeconomic information not captured by household income and comparative information on the state of local housing markets.

The TIGER/Line shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2020 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses. Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some States and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas. These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous. For the 2020 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2010 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area.</span></p></div></div></div>",
