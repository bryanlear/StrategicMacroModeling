This repository houses a long-term project to model the global macroeconomic landscape as a strategic 'chess game' between the US and the Rest of the World (RoW). It involves collecting extensive US macroeconomic and market data (Treasuries, foreign bond holdings, financial assets) to gain a clear view of the 'board.' The ultimate goal is to better anticipate potential 'next moves' by leveraging concepts from Optimal Control Theory, Game Theory, Theory of Combat, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
